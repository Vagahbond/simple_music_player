# Simple audio reader

A simple audio reader using Juce, that I made to get to know about the framework. 

It allows opening, reading, and stopping audio sources of different formats.

## Issues

The sound is somehow distorted. No idea why.


## Future 
this project sets the basics for me to create a music reader using [react juce](https://github.com/nick-thompson/react-juce).


## Special note
With the file browser from JUCE not working, I used a convenient library called [portable-file-dialogs](https://github.com/samhocevar/portable-file-dialogs) written by [samhocevar](https://github.com/samhocevar).
